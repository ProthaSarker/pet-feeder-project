The automated feeder is given inputs (sensors, time information) and generates outputs (motor movement, alarms, records). Each of the data types is then specified in terms of example values, operation parameters, and restrictions so the system is realistic and testable.

  Sample Operational Parameters
•	Feeding Times: 2 times per day (08:00 AM and 06:00 PM).
•	Food Portion Size: ~100 grams per feed
•	Bowl Weight Check: Immediately, at the time of immediate dispensing, and 10 minutes thereafter.
•	Weight: ±5 grams.

Alerts:                                                                          
• Activated if hopper is not full before feeding.
• Activated if bowl weight remains the same 10 minutes after feeding.
